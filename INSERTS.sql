Some examples of time are seven o clock, ten past eight, quarter past nine, half past eleven, twenty to six, quarter to twelve. I explain the words midday, noon and midnight. \n\nIn English, to make it clear what time of the day we are talking about we use several time expressions like "in the morning", "in the afternoon", "in the evening" and "at night" Alternatively we can use the "am" and "pm" abbreviations. The 24 hour clock is rarely used in English except for timetables and in the military. I finish this English lesson with some exercises to test your understanding. \nThe accent of the commentary is a British English accent.','https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9p_pdjhPfMs/hqdefault.jpg','05/16/2017','video','https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9p_pdjhPfMs','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p_pdjhPfMs');

insert into magazines values (4,'Exceptions: Choosing A or An','Here are a few exceptions to the general rule of using a before words that start with consonants and an before words that begin with vowels. The first letter of the word honor, for example, is a consonant, but it’s unpronounced. In spite of its spelling, the word honor begins with a vowel sound. Therefore, we use an. Consider the example sentence below for an illustration of this concept.\n\nIncorrect : My mother is a honest woman.\nCorrect : My mother is an honest woman.\n\nSimilarly, when the first letter of a word is a vowel but is pronounced with a consonant sound, use a, as in the sample sentence below:\n\nIncorrect : She is an United States senator.\nCorrect : She is a United States senator.\n\nThis holds true with acronyms and initialisms, too: an LCD display, a UK-based company, an HR department, a URL.','https://static.grammarly.com/assets/files/7bebc5dfd61602d5879c5627ff00d5ba/card_correct.png','12/04/2017','document',null,'https://www.grammarly.com/blog/articles/');
